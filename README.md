## Goal
InspireMe is a freemium app that gives some free inspiration and a lot of paid inspiration.  
This app uses in-app purchases to get the premium features. When the user taps "Get more Quotes", the user is navigated to the in-app purchase where after buying the premium feature the premium quotes gets initialized and shown in the screen.

## What we are using

* Setup new in-app purchases on App Store Connect
* Using the StoreKit API to allow users to purchase premium content
* Using the StoreKit API to detect failure cases
* Using the StoreKit API to restore in-app purchases
* Persisting the state of users' purchases
